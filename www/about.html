                    After 25 years in the technology industry I felt that my skills and passion were not matched to what I was doing. A change in employment was the catalyst I needed to employ my entrepreneurial and teaching skills in a new way. I invited my trusted colleagues to join the journey, and we are now OpenForge Solutions, where we elevate your website to the next level: logins, databases, and more – no matter your platform.
