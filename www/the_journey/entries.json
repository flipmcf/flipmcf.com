This is a space where I will be documenting thoughts, technical challenges, and the evolution of OpenForge Solutions.</p><p>Today, we are starting simple: a JSON-backed content system that separates data from presentation, allowing us to focus on writing without the immediate overhead of a database.</p> <p> The beautiful thing is that I shamelessly used Gemini to write the basics of this system, because getting something into production fast - even if it's a little flawed, is so much better than spending hours on a perfect solution without delivering.</p>  <p> Most of the content of this website was generated with AI, especially the javascript, because writing javascript does not give me joy<p>"
